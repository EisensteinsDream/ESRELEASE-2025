--------------------------------------------------------
This is the 2025 release of everything I am working on. Essentially what's contained here is 5 parts:
--------------------------------------------------------

A) 'PLEX V_1' which is the version 1 release of the PLEXIGLASS game utility library. This is in the directory 'linux/Plexiglass_V_1'. There's a readme in there for more specific details. Even if this is in the Linux version, the source cross-compiles. You just need to get all the dependecies.

B) 'MM Side Tales' v2.0. It's an improved and corrected version of a previously released game called 'MM Side Tales'. It is built off of 'MM Common' and 'PLEX V_1'. Instructions on how to play (in both Linux and Windows) are in 'linux/MM_SideTales/README.txt'.

C) 'MM Common' which is basically just a library that contains important resources for 'MM Side Tales'.

D) Resources for all projects in the 'resources' folder.

E) A template directory for projects built off of 'PLEX V_1' contained in the 'linux\0Template' directory. This has it's own readme for more detailed information on it's operation.
